            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m a recent graduate from Appalachian State University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My academic journey also includes an Associate of Science in Business Administration from Mayland Community College. Throughout my education, I have developed a solid foundation in both technical and business concepts, allowing me to approach problems from diverse perspectives.

            <p>
                Alongside my work, I have maintained an active presence in extracurricular activities. As a member of the Appalachian State ASCII Club and the Game Development Club, I’ve had the opportunity to explore and discuss various computer science topics, from programming techniques to the intricacies of game design. Additionally, I have been a news and feature writer for GoNintendo.com since 2022, where I research and write articles covering the latest trends in gaming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical skill set includes proficiency in multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, SQL, HTML5, and CSS. I am particularly interested in web development. Recently, I have been learning the Godot game engine and am looking forward to what I can create with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to combine my technical skills with my passion for creativity and problem-solving. Whether through collaborative projects, independent work, or continued learning, I am eager to grow both personally and professionally in the fields of computer science and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my personal life, I like to explore many creative avenues, such as photography, woodworking, resin casting, and 3D printing, just to name a few. I am also an avid outdoorsman, enjoying hiking and kayaking.
